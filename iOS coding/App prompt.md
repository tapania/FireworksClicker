Let's make our first iPhone app. I'm thinking of something without backend first, let's just make an addictive cookie clicker style game, but with fireworks theme. Every time the user clicks in the center, a fireworks explodes and makes nice particle effects. Then the user can start expanding by buying multifirework updates, more colorful explosions, autoclickers, firework factories, and all the way to the end of the world explosion.

Before planning the mechanics, please suggest the basic libraries to use for such a game. Let's keep the coding setup simple, maybe just Apple's own libraries where possible.

What is the suggested library setup?
