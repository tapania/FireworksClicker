I want to start developing iOS apps on macOS. I'm familiar with coding, but haven't ever done a single app for iOS. I don't want to learn xcode, so please tell me the minimal set of tools I need to install and if you can install them from command line for me, even better.

Tell me first the basics of ios development tooling and how I can code the minimal Hello World app from the terminal.
