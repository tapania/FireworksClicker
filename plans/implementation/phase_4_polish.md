### 4.2 Gameplay Tuning
- [ ] Play through Levels 1-5.
- [ ] Verify pacing (is it too slow? too fast?).

### 4.3 Final Code Quality Check
- [ ] Run full test suite.
- [ ] Run full lint.
- [ ] Remove any debug print statements.
- [ ] Update `README` / `AGENTS.md` with new architecture details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Game is fun and functional.
- [ ] No missing assets (placeholders).
